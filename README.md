To enhance the learning experience for those already skilled in HTML and CSS, this repository offers pre-built components for the Udemy course. This allows users to bypass the HTML/CSS sections and concentrate on JavaScript, as intended. In addition, the corresponding JavaScript code is also provided, addressing the limitation of non-downloadable course resources.
